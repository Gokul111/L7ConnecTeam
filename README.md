L7ConnecTeam is Litmus7's employee management system aimed at monitoring and evaluating employees during all phases of training. Traditionally, this objective was served in the form of excel sheets which lead to inconsistency in stored data making the analysis error prone and tedious. This project serves as the skeleton for centralised data storage and automated analysis of training.
